# MeshLib
A simple 3d geometry and mesh library implemented by python

Currently, only 2-manifold triangular meshes (orientable/non-orientable) can be handled.

Supported format:
* .obj
* .off
* .m (Hugues Hoppe's format)
* .ply

## A Mesh-Viewer toolkit
A Mesh-Viewer toolkit (GLutils/GLWindowShader.py) is presented to show the loaded mesh. It's implemented by PyOpenGL using GLSL.
